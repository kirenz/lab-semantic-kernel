:::{.callout-important}
Visit the "[Programming Toolkit-webpage](https://kirenz.github.io/lab-toolkit/)" to learn how to meet all requirements.
:::

- **Python**: Anaconda, Anaconda Environment `kernel` and Visual Studio Code
- **Environment**: A folder on your machine called *semantic-kernel* and an environment file with your OpenAI API key.


## Cloud development

Instead of local development, you may also work in a fully configured dev environment in the cloud with GitHub Codespaces. Take a look at [this site](/slide.qmd) to learn more about the different options.
