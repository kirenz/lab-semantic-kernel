Many weekends, I drive a few minutes from my house to a local pizza store to buy \na slice of Hawaiian pizza from the gentleman that owns this pizza store. And his pizza is great, but he always \nhas a lot of cold pizzas sitting around, and every weekend some different flavor of pizza is out of stock. \nBut when I watch him operate his store, I get excited, because by selling pizza, he is generating data. \nAnd this is data that he can take advantage of if he had access to AI.\n\nAI systems are good at spotting patterns when given access to the right data, and perhaps an AI system could spot \nif Mediterranean pizzas sell really well on a Friday night, maybe it could suggest to him to make more of it on a \nFriday afternoon. Now you might say to me, \"Hey, Andrew, this is a small pizza store. What's the big deal?\" And I \nsay, to the gentleman that owns this pizza store, something that could help him improve his revenues by a few \nthousand dollars a year, that will be a huge deal to him.\n\"\"\"\n# Text source: https://www.ted.com/talks/andrew_ng_how_ai_could_empower_any_business/transcript\n\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Run kernel \n\n::: {.cell execution_count=6}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nsummary_result = await kernel.run_async(summary_function,\n                                        input_str=sk_input)\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Output\n\n::: {.cell output-location='slide' execution_count=7}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\ndisplay(Markdown(\"### ✨ \" + str(summary_result)))\n```\n:::\n\n\n- ✨ AI can help a small pizza store owner improve revenues by analyzing data and suggesting changes, like making more popular pizzas on certain days.\n\n## Alternative to run kernel: summary_function\n\n- Shorter version to call semantic function (same result)\n\n. . .\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=8}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nsummary_result = summary_function(sk_input)\n```\n:::\n\n\n. . .\n\n::: {.cell output-location='slide' execution_count=9}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\ndisplay(Markdown(\"### ✨ \" + str(summary_result)))\n```\n:::\n\n\n- ✨ AI can help a small pizza store owner increase revenue by analyzing data to identify patterns and make informed decisions.\n\n# Register Native functions\n\n## Define a function {.smaller}\n\n- Write some function\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=10}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nclass ExoticLanguagePlugin:\n    def word_to_pig_latin(self, word):\n        vowels = \"AEIOUaeiou\"\n        if word[0] in vowels:\n            return word + \"way\"\n        for idx, letter in enumerate(word):\n            if letter in vowels:\n                break\n        else:\n            return word + \"ay\"\n        return word[idx:] + word[:idx] + \"ay\"\n\n    @sk_function(\n        description=\"Takes text and converts it to pig latin\",\n        name=\"pig_latin\",\n        input_description=\"The text to convert to pig latin\",\n    )\n    def pig_latin(self, sentence: str) -> str:\n        words = sentence.split()\n        pig_latin_words = []\n        for word in words:\n            pig_latin_words.append(self.word_to_pig_latin(word))\n        return ' '.join(pig_latin_words)\n\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Register function\n\n- Register custom function in the kernel\n\n. . .\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=11}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nexotic_language_plugin = kernel.import_skill(\n    ExoticLanguagePlugin(), skill_name=\"exotic_language_plugin\")\n\npig_latin_function = exotic_language_plugin[\"pig_latin\"]\n\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Run kernel with semantic function and native function\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=12}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nfinal_result = await kernel.run_async(summary_function,\n                                      pig_latin_function,\n                                      input_str=sk_input)\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Output\n\n::: {.cell output-location='slide' execution_count=13}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\ndisplay(Markdown(\"### ✨ \" + str(final_result)))\n```\n:::\n\n\n- ✨ AIway ancay elphay away allsmay izzapay orestay ownerway increaseway evenueray byay analyzingway ataday andway uggestingsay opularpay izzapay avorsflay onway ecificspay ays.day\n\n\n# SWOT Basics\n\n## Strengths\n\n1. **Strengths**\n    - What unique recipes or ingredients does the pizza shop use?\n    - What are the skills and experience of the staff?\n    - Does the pizza shop have a strong reputation in the local area?\n    - Are there any unique features of the shop or its location that attract customers?\n\n## Weaknesses\n\n2. **Weaknesses**\n    - What are the operational challenges of the pizza shop?
