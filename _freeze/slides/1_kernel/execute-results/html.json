To do so, the kernel runs a¬†[pipeline / chain](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/create-chains/)¬†that is defined by a developer. While the chain is run, a common context is provided by the kernel so data can be shared between functions. |\n| 2.1 | Memories | With a specialized plugin, a developer can recall and store context in vector databases. This allows developers to simulate¬†[memory](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/memories/)¬†within their AI apps. |\n| 2.2 | Planner | Developers can ask Semantic Kernel to auto create chains to address novel needs for a user.¬†[Planner](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/create-chains/planner)¬†achieves this by mixing-and-matching plugins that have already been loaded into the kernel to create additional steps. This is similar to how ChatGPT, Bing, and Microsoft 365 Copilot combines plugins together in their experiences. |\n| 2.3 | Connectors | To get additional data or to perform autonomous actions, you can use out-of-the-box plugins like the Microsoft Graph Connector kit or create a custom connector to provide data to your own services. |\n| 2.4 | Custom plugins | As a developer, you can create custom plugins that run inside of Semantic Kernel. These plugins can consist of either LLM prompts (semantic functions) or native C# or Python code (native function). This allows you to add new AI capabilities and integrate your existing apps and services into Semantic Kernel. |\n| 3 | Response | Once the kernel is done, you can send the response back to the user to let them know the process is complete. |\n\n[Source: Microsoft](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/overview/#seeing-ai-orchestration-with-semantic-kernel)\n\n\n# Create Kernels\n\n## Setup\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=1}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nfrom semantic_kernel.connectors.ai.hugging_face import HuggingFaceTextCompletion\nimport semantic_kernel as sk\nfrom semantic_kernel.connectors.ai.open_ai import AzureChatCompletion, OpenAIChatCompletion\n```\n:::\n\n\n## OpenAI Kernel\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=2}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nkernel = sk.Kernel()\n\napi_key, org_id = sk.openai_settings_from_dot_env()\n\nkernel.add_text_completion_service(\n    \"openai\", OpenAIChatCompletion(\"gpt-3.5-turbo\", api_key, org_id))\n```\n:::\n\n\n## AzureOpenAI (optional)\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=3}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# kernel = sk.Kernel()\n\n# deployment, api_key, endpoint = sk.azure_openai_settings_from_dot_env()\n\n# kernel.add_text_completion_service(\n#         \"azureopenai\", AzureChatCompletion(deployment, endpoint, api_key))\n```\n:::\n\n\n## HuggingFace Kernel\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=4}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nkernel = sk.Kernel()\n\nkernel.add_text_completion_service(\n    \"huggingface\", HuggingFaceTextCompletion(\"gpt2\", task=\"text-generation\"))\n\n\nprint(\"You made an open source kernel using an open source AI model!\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n# What's next? {background-image=\"../images/logo.png\" background-opacity=\"0.5\"}\n\n**Congratulations!
