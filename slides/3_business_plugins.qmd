# Business Plugins

# Setup

## Python


```{python}
import semantic_kernel as sk
from semantic_kernel.connectors.ai.open_ai import AzureChatCompletion, OpenAIChatCompletion
from IPython.display import display, Markdown
```

## Kernel

```{python}
kernel = sk.Kernel()

api_key, org_id = sk.openai_settings_from_dot_env()

kernel.add_text_completion_service(
    "openai", OpenAIChatCompletion("gpt-3.5-turbo", api_key, org_id))

```

# Business Plugins

## Business goals

1. Grow the existing business
2. Save money and time
3. Add completely new business
4. Prepare for the unknown

## Plugins directory {.smaller}

```directory
plugins-sk/
‚îÇ
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ BusinessThinking/
     |
     ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ BasicStrategies/
     |    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ config.json
     |    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ skprompt.txt
     |
     ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ SeekCostEfficiency/
     |    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ config.json
     |    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ skprompt.txt
     |
     ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ SeekTimeEfficiency/
          ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ config.json
          ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ skprompt.txt
```

## Activate plugins

```{python}
pluginsDirectory = "../plugins-sk"

pluginBT = kernel.import_semantic_skill_from_directory(
    pluginsDirectory, "BusinessThinking")

```

# Cost Efficiency 

## Input strengths and weaknesses {.smaller}

```{python}
strengths = ["Unique garlic pizza recipe that wins top awards", "Owner trained in Sicily at some of the best pizzerias",
             "Strong local reputation", "Prime location on university campus"]

weaknesses = ["High staff turnover", "Floods in the area damaged the seating areas that are in need of repair",
              "Absence of popular calzones from menu", "Negative reviews from younger demographic for lack of hip ingredients"]

```

## Context

```{python}

my_context = kernel.create_new_context()

my_context['input'] = 'makes pizzas'
my_context['strengths'] = ", ".join(strengths)
my_context['weaknesses'] = ", ".join(weaknesses)

```

## Run kernel with cost efficiency plugin

```{python}

costefficiency_result = await kernel.run_async(pluginBT["SeekCostEfficiency"], input_context=my_context)

```

## Output

```{python}
costefficiency_str = str(
    "### ‚ú® Suggestions for how to gain cost efficiencies\n" + str(costefficiency_result))
```

. . .

```{python}
display(Markdown(costefficiency_str))
```

# Business Strategy

## Input opportunities and threats

```{python}
opportunities = ["Untapped catering potential", "Growing local tech startup community",
                 "Unexplored online presence and order capabilities", "Upcoming annual food fair"]

threats = ["Competition from cheaper pizza businesses nearby", "There's nearby street construction that will impact foot traffic",
           "Rising cost of cheese will increase the cost of pizzas", "No immediate local regulatory changes but it's election season"]

```

## Import plugin

```{python}

pluginBT = kernel.import_semantic_skill_from_directory(
    pluginsDirectory, "BusinessThinking")

```

## Context

```{python}
my_context = kernel.create_new_context()

my_context['input'] = 'makes pizzas'
my_context['strengths'] = ", ".join(strengths)
my_context['weaknesses'] = ", ".join(weaknesses)
my_context['opportunities'] = ", ".join(opportunities)
my_context['threats'] = ", ".join(threats)
```

## Run kernel 

```{python}

bizstrat_result = await kernel.run_async(pluginBT["BasicStrategies"], input_context=my_context)

```

## Output

```{python}

bizstrat_str = "## ‚ú® Business strategy thinking based on SWOT analysis\n" + \
    str(bizstrat_result)

```

. . .

```{python}
display(Markdown(bizstrat_str))
```

| Streamlining operations             | Strong local reputation                         | High staff turnover                   | Implementing efficient processes and systems to reduce the need for excessive staff and improve productivity. This can include automating certain tasks, cross-training employees, and optimizing workflow.                                       |
| Renovating seating areas            | Prime location on university campus             | Floods damaging seating areas         | Investing in repairing and renovating the seating areas to attract more customers and enhance the dining experience. This can include redesigning the layout, upgrading furniture and fixtures, and creating a comfortable and inviting ambiance. |
| Adding popular calzones to the menu | Unique garlic pizza recipe that wins top awards | Absence of popular calzones from menu | Expanding the menu to include popular calzones can attract a wider customer base and increase sales. This can be achieved by developing delicious and unique calzone recipes that align with the business's culinary expertise and reputation.    |
