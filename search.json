We will explore three key concerns that can help the business owner save time and improve operations.\n\n# The Question\n- How can the business owner save time?\n\n# Key Concerns\n\n1. Unexplored online presence and order capabilities\n2. Untapped catering potential\n3. Growing local tech startup community\n\n# Unexplored Online Presence and Order Capabilities\n\n- Explanation: The business can save time by implementing online ordering capabilities and improving their online presence. This will allow customers to place orders without the need for phone calls or in-person visits.\n\n- Example: The business can create a website with an online ordering system and integrate it with their social media accounts. This will allow customers to easily place orders and the business can save time by not having to take orders over the phone.\n\n# Untapped Catering Potential\n\n- Explanation: The business can save time by exploring catering opportunities. This will allow the business to serve multiple customers at once and potentially increase revenue.\n\n- Example: The business can create a catering menu and market it to local businesses and events. This will allow the business to serve multiple customers at once and save time by not having to prepare individual orders.\n\n# Growing Local Tech Startup Community\n\n- Explanation: The business can save time by targeting under-served customer segments or market areas. The growing local tech startup community is an opportunity for the business to gain new customers and potentially increase revenue.\n\n- Example: The business can create a marketing campaign targeted towards the local tech startup community. This will allow the business to gain new customers and potentially increase revenue.\n\n# Summary\n\n- By implementing online ordering capabilities, exploring catering opportunities, and targeting under-served customer segments, the business owner can save time and improve operations."

To do so, the kernel runs a pipeline / chain that is defined by a developer. While the chain is run, a common context is provided by the kernel so data can be shared between functions.\n\n\n2.1\nMemories\nWith a specialized plugin, a developer can recall and store context in vector databases. This allows developers to simulate memory within their AI apps.\n\n\n2.2\nPlanner\nDevelopers can ask Semantic Kernel to auto create chains to address novel needs for a user. Planner achieves this by mixing-and-matching plugins that have already been loaded into the kernel to create additional steps. This is similar to how ChatGPT, Bing, and Microsoft 365 Copilot combines plugins together in their experiences.\n\n\n2.3\nConnectors\nTo get additional data or to perform autonomous actions, you can use out-of-the-box plugins like the Microsoft Graph Connector kit or create a custom connector to provide data to your own services.\n\n\n2.4\nCustom plugins\nAs a developer, you can create custom plugins that run inside of Semantic Kernel. These plugins can consist of either LLM prompts (semantic functions) or native C# or Python code (native function). This allows you to add new AI capabilities and integrate your existing apps and services into Semantic Kernel.\n\n\n3\nResponse\nOnce the kernel is done, you can send the response back to the user to let them know the process is complete.\n\n\n\nSource: Microsoft"
